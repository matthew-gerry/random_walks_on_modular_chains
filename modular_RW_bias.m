% Statistcs for a classical random walk with transition rates based on a
% quantum mechanical model with tunnelling coupling between sites on a
% molecule/chain and local decoherence. Decoherence rates alternate in
% modules of sizes nA and nB (specified). Here we investigate the case with
% bias (constant ratio of forward to reverse rates passed to the function
% diffusionLchi which builds the counting field-dressed Liouvillian).
